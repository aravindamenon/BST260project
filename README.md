Title: Factors affecting housing inflation costs in metropolitan and suburban Boston during the COVID-19 pandemic

Our main analysis file is `boston_housing_project.Rmd`.

This file uses data from: 

* Boston government website (CSV pulled from online)

* Redfin and Boston magazine websites (webscraping)

* 2021 Redfin data pulled into a CSV, `Redfin_2021_SalesData.csv`

* This image file is in the R markdown as reference: `aqi.png`

* These files are in the R markdown as reference, but ultimately not used in the analysis, so were removed from the repository: `MA_2019_ADI_9 Digit Zip Code_v3.1.txt`, `MA_2015_ADI_9 Digit Zip Code_v3.1.txt`, `boston-air-quality.csv`, `boston-north end-air-quality.csv`, `boston-roxbury-air-quality.csv`, `boston-von hillern-air-quality.csv`

* Exported version of rando: `rando.csv`
