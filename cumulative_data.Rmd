Cleaning up names of variables (2021 had some different ones), limiting data to residential property only, selecting for variables of interest:

### Air Quality Index (AQI)

Reading in [AQI data](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/register/):

_Note:_ We had air quality data in the form of PM2.5 (Parameter name PM2.5 local conditions), which were subsequently converted to AQI by this table. Given we didn't have all the data to use the AQI calculation and derive exact numbers, we instead made AQI a factor variable with 5 levels using the following table:

### Area Deprivation Index (ADI)

Reading in ADI data from the [Neighborhood Atlas website](https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu/).

_Note:_ Codebook as follows:

* TYPE: P indicates post office; U indicates unique zipcode; standard zip codes are left blank

* ZIPID: The 9 digit zip code ID 

* FIPS: The block group Census ID

* GISJOIN: Key linkage field to the block group shapefile served by NHGIS

* ADI_NATRANK: National percentile of block group ADI score. PH for suppression due to low population and/or housing, GQ for suppression due to a high group quarters population, and PH-GQ for suppression due to both types of suppression criteria.

* ADI_STATERNK: State-specific decile of block group ADI score. PH for suppression due to low population and/or housing, GQ for suppression due to a high group quarters population, and PH-GQ for suppression due to both types of suppression criteria.

**_Note:_ Given that we had ADI data available for 2015 and 2019 only, for analysis purposes, the assumption was made that 2015 is comparable enough to 2017, when our analysis begins.**

Included neighborhoods using zipcodes based on http://archive.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/04/15/sixfigurezipcodes_city/.

Combining all of the dataframes for 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020.
Datatable information: 
This table includes aggregate data from all neighborhoods of Boston. The 2015-2019 data is from [Boston Magazine](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/best-places-to-live-2017-condos/) and the associated pages of each year. The 2020 data is from [Redfin](https://www.redfin.com/city/1826/MA/Boston/housing-market) and the associated individual neighborhood pages.

Description of data within columns:
* Neighborhood - factor w 27 levels; includes all neighborhoods of Boston (Allston, Back Bay, Bay Village South End, Beacon Hill, Brighton, Charlestown, Chestnut Hill, Chinatown Leather District, Dorchester, Downtown, East Boston, Fenway, Hyde Park, Jamaica Plain, Mattapan, North End West End, Roslindale, Roxbury, Seaport District, South Boston, West Roxbury, Citywide). __Of note__, data is only available for Seaport District and Downtown, and Chestnut Hill in _Redfin_. Data is only available for Citywide in _Boston Magazine_. Brookline, Cambridge, and Sommerville were included as neighborhoods of interest althought they are not considered to be in Boston. The row for Boston is a composite measurement that is included in both Redfin and some of the Boston Magazine data.
* Year - number
* Avg Sale Price - number; median price was used for _Boston Magazine_, unclear which measurement was used to calculate the average sale price listed by _Redfin_.
* Price Per SqFt - number; only available for Redfin data.
* Number Sold - number; units sold in that neighborhood, missing from _Boston Magazine_ 2017 data.
* Type - character; _Boston Magazine_ data was stratified by condo verses single family housing units. In the 2015 and 2016 data both condo and single family housing data was available for the neighborhoods of Boston and Brookline, Cambridge, Sommerville. Subsequent years condo data is only availble for the neighborhoods of Boston while housing data is only for Brookline, Cambridge, Sommerville, and the composite Boston category.

2021 housing sales data scraped from Redfin.

Rbind of all seperate housing datafiles into master dataframe.

Data scraped from Redfin of listed recently sold properties stratified by neighborhood.

* Address - property address
* Sale.Price - price sold
* Sqr.Ft - square footage
* Bedrooms - no. bedrooms (NA listed for lofts)
* Baths - no. baths
* Neighborhood
* Walk.Score - numeric score out of 100
* School.District - 6 schools are listed given Boston lottery system

**OF NOTE:** *There are duplicate entries for each individual property becuase 6 different schools are listed for each property. Decision will need to be made if we just want to select the first school listed or do some data wrangling where we group by address.

### Joining all data for analysis

```{r}
# Dataset of all the factors affecting prices
factors_long <- eval_all %>% 
  left_join(aqi_all) %>%  #joining by year, neighborhood
  left_join(adi_all)

# Dataset of all the factors plus sold prices from Redfin and Boston Magazine
full_long <- factors_long %>% 
  full_join(df.bos.housing)
